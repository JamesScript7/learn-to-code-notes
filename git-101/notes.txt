GIT:

Vocab:

Repo - project folder that you initialized with git
Local/Remote repo - on your comp/on github
Git - A source control system system to track changes on your file.

cat > hello.txt
this will enable you to write inside it.

cat >> robin.txt
will create the file.

cd ~
to go back to the home directory.

git config --list
to list your settings.

in atom the files show up green to show it's a new file.

git diff
to see the difference

git diff --cached

for vim, when you open up in the terminal, you have to type "i" in order to "insert"

:wq
write quit

in the description you should write why it changed.

git show
shows you the last changes

git remote --verbose
will give you your origin info

*git push -u origin master

	-u
	stands for upstream (tracks the upstream)

*git pull --rebase origin master
(after you edit something on git hub)

	pull request:
	git checkout -b

git checkout -b add-more-toppings
(will switch to a new branch)

*git push -u origin add-more-toppings
(when you want to push your new local branch to it)

Go to github and click compare pull request
continue to merge and delete the branch.

	*you don't want to push your master... you'd want to create a branch and then push that

you want your branched to be protected.

Fork is a copy of a repo, you can't make changes to it but you can make changes to the copy.


Pull request:
A request to modify the orignal repo
the original author has to OK it.


CONFLICTS
example was when both masters (local and github) was changed.

git pull --rebase origin master

*darx - merging files?

rebase is safer
