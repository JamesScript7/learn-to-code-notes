let ***

var name = String("remko");
much more information on the input.

some people place the script tag in the head when using jQuery because it has dependencies(?) to use it as a reference.

true represents 1
false represents 0

you can assign a variable null.... but it makes it difficult when type checking or debugging?

but usually it's good to assign an undefined variable null?


?: ***
for comparison...
age > 21 ? "yes" : "no"


instanceof ***


var arr = new Array()
is not better then "var arr = [];" because it's just more code..

JSON.stringify
turns an object into a string.
it's a string! (stringify the JS object to the server)
turns it into an associative array


var a = JSON.stringify({'name': 'remko'};)

.push() 
.pop() takes last element
.unshift() puts a new element in beggining of the array
.shift()

arr.splice(1,0,'a','b');
(used for jQuery modification?)

some array methods:
mutates the original array
and some creates a new array

splice creates a new array as the return value.

arr.sort() - sorts only strings
you'll have to add a custom function
function(a,b) {a-b}

iterations:

for ITEM in LIST

in your while loop:
continue (if u want to break the current iteration but continue to the next one.)


debugging error checking:
try...catch... finally

functions:

browser life cycles!
ex: when body gets loaded.

remember you can pass in a function in a function
